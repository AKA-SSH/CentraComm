#### 1. Introduction

Financial fraud detection is critical for maintaining the integrity of financial institutions and protecting customers from fraudulent activities. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to adapt to evolving fraud tactics, necessitating the implementation of machine learning (ML) techniques. This project report outlines the steps taken to implement ML-based fraud detection, the methodologies used, and the outcomes achieved.
