#### Introduction

Efficient project management and access to relevant information are critical for the success of any organization. Traditional methods of managing project documentation and employee expertise often result in data silos, making it challenging for employees to find the information they need. This report investigates the potential benefits of an AI-powered system that integrates both unstructured and structured data to facilitate better project management and knowledge sharing.

#### Objectives

1. To centralize project documentation and employee expertise into a single database.
2. To develop an intelligent chatbot that can provide technical solutions and recommend relevant documents and employees.
3. To enhance overall employee productivity and collaboration within the organization.

---

#### Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Unstructured Data: Project reports, research reports, and technical reports in PDF format.
   - Structured Data: Employee details and project information stored in CSV files.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Extract text and metadata from PDFs using Apache Tika.
   - Normalize and clean CSV data for consistency.

3. **Indexing:**
   - Index unstructured data using Elasticsearch for efficient retrieval.
   - Store structured data in a relational database for easy querying.

4. **Chatbot Development:**
   - Integrate NLP models to understand user queries.
   - Implement retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques to provide initial responses.
   - Develop a recommendation system for suggesting relevant documents and top employees.

5. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Conduct user testing to ensure accuracy and relevance of responses.
   - Refine data processing and indexing techniques based on feedback.

#### Results

1. **Centralized Database:**
   - Successfully centralized project documentation and employee expertise into a single database.
   - Improved data accessibility and search capabilities through efficient indexing.

2. **Chatbot Functionality:**
   - Developed a chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries.
   - Implemented a recommendation system to suggest relevant documents and employees based on user needs.

3. **Employee Productivity:**
   - Enhanced employee productivity by reducing the time spent searching for information.
   - Facilitated better collaboration by connecting employees with relevant expertise.

#### Discussion

The implementation of an AI-powered project management system has demonstrated significant improvements in data accessibility and employee productivity. The intelligent chatbot, leveraging RAG techniques, has proven effective in delivering precise answers and recommendations. However, continuous refinement is necessary to address evolving user needs and to incorporate feedback.

---

#### Conclusion

This research highlights the potential of AI-powered systems in transforming project management and knowledge sharing within organizations. By centralizing data and leveraging intelligent chatbot interfaces, companies can significantly enhance employee productivity and collaboration. Future work will focus on further refining the system and exploring additional functionalities to meet the dynamic needs of the organization.

---

#### Recommendations

1. **Expand Data Sources:**
   - Incorporate additional data sources, such as emails and meeting transcripts, to provide a more comprehensive knowledge base.

2. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Regularly update the NLP models and indexing techniques to improve accuracy and relevance.
   - Gather user feedback to refine the chatbot’s capabilities.

3. **Training and Adoption:**
   - Conduct training sessions for employees to familiarize them with the new system.
   - Encourage adoption by demonstrating the system’s benefits in enhancing productivity and collaboration.
